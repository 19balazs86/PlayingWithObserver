# Playing with Observer Design Pattern, Rx.NET

This small application is an example for the [Observer Design Pattern in .NET](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/events/observer-design-pattern "Observer Design Pattern in .NET") using the [Reactive Extension - Rx.NET](https://github.com/dotnet/reactive "Reactive Extension - Rx.NET").

Maybe, the [ReactiveX](http://reactivex.io "ReactiveX") concept is not the most popular framework in the .NET, unlike the Front-end side with JS.

Anyway, You can find 4 simple use cases in this project, just to give you some hint.
